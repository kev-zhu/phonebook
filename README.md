# Phonebook Web App
This phonebook web app was built as part of a Full Stack Open assignment to gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack. The application uses React on the frontend to build a responsive single-page interface with reusable components, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express to handle routing and HTTP requests. Contact data is stored in a cloud-hosted MongoDB database, and CRUD operations are performed through RESTful API calls. During development, I configured the backend to run on a specified port and connect to the database using environment variables and asynchronous setup logic.

## Lessons
This project marked my first deep dive into full-stack development with the MERN stack. I learned how to build functional React components, manage state with hooks, and structure a frontend to communicate effectively with a backend service. On the backend, I implemented Express routes to handle CRUD operations and connected the server to MongoDB Atlas. I also gained experience configuring development environments, including setting up environment variables and managing server ports. It was also my first time working with a cloud-based database, which gave me valuable insight into persistent data storage and deployment considerations.

## Technologies

- `MongoDB`
- `Express`
- `Node`
- `React`
- `CSS`

## Features
The app includes core functionality expected from a phonebook: users can add, delete, update, and search for contacts. A filter function allows users to easily narrow down entries by name. React handles the user interface and manages the appâ€™s state dynamically as user actions update the contact list. The backend processes requests to retrieve or modify contact data, which is stored in MongoDB. This project focuses on core full-stack interaction and learning the MERN tech stack.
